# Rock Paper Scissors 

This is an example of a domain model of a Rock Paper Scissors game. It's implemented using events (but without any frameworks so that it's easy to test).
The Game state is mutable in order to avoid making it too unfamiliar for Java developers used to this way of coding. The purpose of this repository is to provide 
a "real world" example of a simple domain model that can be tested with JUnit 5.
